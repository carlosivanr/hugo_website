My experience and research has prepared me to teach several courses typically found in a psychology department. I have taught a lower division introduction to brain & behavior course in face-to-face and online formats. Additionally, I am able to teach lower division statistics and upper division research methods. Finally, I am able to teach cognitive psychology and drugs & behavior.

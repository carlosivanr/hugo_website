Learn how to install R and RStudio

<!--more-->


## Module Objectives
- Install R
- Install RStudio


#### Install R
The first step in this module is to install two separate programs. First, we will need to install R. R can be downloaded from https://www.r-project.org/ and is available for Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems. You will need to:
- select a CRAN mirror, 
- select your operating system
- select a version of R that is compatible with your operating system version
- download and install R

After completing the installation of R, we are technically ready to run R from the command line. For example, in macOS, we would be able to start working with R by opening the Terminal App and typing "R" at the prompt. However, there's an alternative and more user-friendly way of using R with RStudio instead.


#### Install RStudio
RStudio is an interactive development environment (IDE) for R. It's a program that allows us to interact with R, navigate through file folders, develop code, and see the output from our analyses or plots. So, the second step for this module is to install the free desktop version of R Studio by visiting https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. The webpage should automatically detect the recommended version for your operating system which you can download and install.

#### Wrap Up
In this module, we took two small, but important, steps in learning how to use R and RStudio.

<!-- ## Quiz

{{< spoiler text="What is the difference between lists and tuples?" >}}
Lists

- Lists are mutable - they can be changed
- Slower than tuples
- Syntax: `a_list = [1, 2.0, 'Hello world']`

Tuples

- Tuples are immutable - they can't be changed
- Tuples are faster than lists 
- Syntax: `a_tuple = (1, 2.0, 'Hello world')`

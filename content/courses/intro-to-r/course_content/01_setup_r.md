Setup R and RStudio

<!--more-->


## Module Objectives
- Install R
- Install RStudio


#### Install R
The first step in this module is to install two separate programs. First, we will need to install R. R can be downloaded from https://www.r-project.org/ and is available for Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems. First you will need to select a CRAN mirror, then your operating system, and finally select a version of R that is compatible with your operating system version.

After completing the installation of R, we would be able to use R from the command line. For example, in macOS, we would be able to start working with R by opening the Terminal App and typing "R" at the prompt. However, there's a more user friendly way of working with R through RStudio.


#### Install RStudio
RStudio is an interactive development environment (IDE) for R. What that means, is that it's a program that allows us to interact with R, navigate through file folders, develop code, and see the output from our analyses or plots. So, the second step for this module is to install the free desktop version of R Studio by visiting https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. The webpage should automatically detect the recommended version for your operating system which you can download and install.

{{< spoiler text="What is the difference between lists and tuples?" >}}
Lists

- Lists are mutable - they can be changed
- Slower than tuples
- Syntax: `a_list = [1, 2.0, 'Hello world']`

Tuples

- Tuples are immutable - they can't be changed
- Tuples are faster than lists 
- Syntax: `a_tuple = (1, 2.0, 'Hello world')`

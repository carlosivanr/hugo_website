## Overview
In this short course, we will explore how to conduct variations of ANOVA designs in R with freely available packages. We will focus on how to code the statistical tests and their interpretation rather than building a conceptual understanding of the tests. For many of the walkthroughs, we will rely on the AMCP package. AMCP is the R package for Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelley's 3rd edition of ["Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A model comparison perspective"](https://designingexperiments.com/) which is what I recommend for a conceptual background. We will also rely a handful of R packages including `jmv`, `rstatix`, `ggpubr`, and `tidyverse`.

## What you will learn
- One-way ANOVA in R
- Two-way ANOVA in R
- Repeated measures one-way ANOVA in R

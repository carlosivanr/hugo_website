## Overview
This short course explores how to conduct various ANOVA statistical tests in R with freely available packages. Focus is placed on demonstrating how to implement ANOVA tests in R rather than providing a readers with a conceptual background. That task is best accomplished by picking up what's been described as the ANOVA bible - Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelley's 3rd edition of ["Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A model comparison perspective"](https://designingexperiments.com/). For many of the modules, the AMCP package, which is the accompanying R package for the Maxwell et al. text, for sample data sets. We will also rely a handful of other R packages including `jmv`, `rstatix`, `ggpubr`, and `tidyverse`.

# Overview
The following how-to guides explore how to conduct correlation and regression analyses in R. Focus is placed on how to implement simple and multiple regression in R rather than providing a conceptual background. That task can be accomplished by picking up a copy of Field, Miles, and Field's 1st edition of ["Discovering Statistics Using R"](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/). The Field et al. text is an excellent introduction to many different types of statistical analyses and how to conduct them in R. I will also use the sample data sets to demonstrate these performing correlation and regression in R.

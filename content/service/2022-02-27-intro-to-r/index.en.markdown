This service project was conducted in collaboration with a dear colleague of mine at California State University, Chico. I prepared and delivered a presentation covering basic concepts in R for undergraduate and masters students in the Psychology department. As a neuroimaging researcher, learning a programming language was fundamental my success. However, when I got to graduate school, I had no previous computer programming experience whatsoever. For the work that I was doing, I had to pick up MATLAB and I did so by going through line by line of scripts that previous lab members had written. While I eventually acquired up the skills, I wish I would have had a formal introduction to facilitate the learning process. Now that I have gone on to learn R and some Python, I wanted to provide up and coming researchers with a bit of an introduction to R so that they can apply it to their own research projects. These materials for this presentation can be found on my github page [here](https://github.com/carlosivanr/intro_to_R).

### The overarching question:

The brain is composed of billions of cells that communicate with one another. This communication allows us to take in information from our environment, generate movement, produce thoughts, and many other functions. 

Many approaches to studying the brain focus on a single brain region. However, the the brain does not function as isolated brain regions


### Tools & Methods
I use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity during a scan in which subject are not asked to perform a behavioral or cognitive task. This fMRI data is then placed through a blind source separation algorithm called independent components ananlysis (ICA). This algorithm pulls out sets of voxels from the fMRI data that tend to have similar activity patterns. These extracted components represent resting state networks. We can then calculate the correlation of activity between different brain networks to measure functional network connectivity (FNC). The FNC measures can then be used as dependent variables to compare across multiple conditions or to examine the relationship between connectivity and other variables such as a subjects cognitive performance.

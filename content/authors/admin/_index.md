I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mind Research Network (MRN) in Albuquerque, NM. At the MRN, I primarily use functional neuroimaging to study the influence of alcohol and drugs on functional brain connectivity. My research experiences has provided a strong foundation in using MATLAB, R, and Python to manage and process data, perform statistical analyses, and produce data visualizations. I have disseminated my research findings via peer reviewed journals and orally through conference presentations. My professional experiences outside of research center on teaching, advising, and leading efforts to implement findings from the science of learning into university student success programs. Lastly, I have a longstanding commitment to mentor students from under-represented backgrounds in academic research.

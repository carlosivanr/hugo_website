I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, NM. At the MRN, I rely on functional neuroimaging technology to better understand how alcohol and other drugs of abuse affect the way brain regions communicate with one another. Our hope is that with a better idea of how this miscommunication occurs, we will be better positioned to develop treatments for alcohol abuse and ways of identifying the presence of prenatal alcohol exposure.

My professional and educational experiences have provided a solid foundation in experimental research design, statistical analyses, and public speaking. I am experienced in using MATLAB, R, and Python to manage, process, and analyse small and large data sets. My research has been shared in peer reviewed journals, conference presentations, and invited talks. Outside of research, my professional experiences center on teaching, advising, and leading efforts to implement research findings from the science of learning into university student success programs. Lastly, I have a longstanding commitment to mentoring students from under-represented backgrounds in academic research through my involvement with the Society for Neuroscience and the University of New Mexico's El Centro de la Raza.

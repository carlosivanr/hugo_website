I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, NM. I primarily use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the influence of alcohol and drugs on functional brain connectivity.

I also have experience in teaching university level introduction to behavioral neuroscience, leading efforts to implement psychological science research in university student success programs, and actively mentor students from under-represented groups interested in research careers.

Welcome, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mind Research Network (MRN) in Albuquerque, NM. At the MRN, I primarily use functional neuroimaging to study the influence of alcohol and drugs on brain connectivity. My research experiences have provided a strong foundation in using MATLAB, R, and Python to manage and process data, and perform statistical analyses. I have disseminated my research via peer reviewed journals and orally through conference presentations and invited talks. My professional experiences outside of research center on teaching, advising, and leading efforts to implement research findings from the science of learning into university student success programs. Lastly, I have a longstanding commitment to mentoring students from under-represented backgrounds in academic research. Feel free to reach out to me to learn more about my work.

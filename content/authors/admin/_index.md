I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, NM. My research primarily centers on investigating the consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure on resting state functional brain connectivity using animal models and human-subjects research. I am also currently pursuing research projects that explore brain connectivity in adolescents and in individuals with histories of substance use.

I am experienced in teaching introductory brain & behavior, leading efforts to implement psychological science research in university student success programs, and actively mentor undergraduate students from under-represented interested in research careers.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, NM. At the MRN, I'm involved in a number of projects that rely on use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the influence of alcohol and drugs on functional brain connectivity and on adolescent brain development.

In addition to my research, I have experience in teaching university level introduction to behavioral neuroscience, leading efforts to implement psychological science research in university student success programs, and actively mentor students from under-represented groups interested in research careers.

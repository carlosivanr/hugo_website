  caption: 'Figure 1 Boxplots and results of between-group comparisons of graph theory metrics within threshold. Solid horizontal lines within each box represent the median, while dotted lines represent the mean. Panel A) modularity; B) clustering coefficient, C) characteristic path length, D) global efficiency. CNTRL, controls; ARND, alcohol neurodevelopmental disorder, FAS, fetal alcohol syndrome. ****, p<0.0001; ***, p<0.001; **, p<0.01; *, p<0.05. All p values are corrected by FDR method. For analyses of characteristic path length, one data point from a CNTRL participant at the 0.2 threshold was excluded as an outlier resulting in a sample size of 35. All other remaining sample sizes were CNTRL=36, ARND=9, and FAS=13.'

### Summary:
In this study, colleagues and I examined resting state functional MRI data from a sample of adolescents and young adults with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We discovered that mild and severe forms of FASD displayed changes in network measures in opposing patterns relative to controls. Our data suggest that while some network characteristics are compromised in a severe form FASD, they are enhanced in a less severe FASD possibly due to a compensatory mechanism.
